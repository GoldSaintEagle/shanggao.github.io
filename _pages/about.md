Background
======

Dr. Shang is the research assistant professor in the Department of Computing in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He obtained his Ph.D. degree from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2019, supervised by [Dr. Bin XIAO](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csbxiao/). He received his M.Eng. degree from Southeast University, China and B.Ss. degree from Hangzhou Dianzi University, China, in 2014 and 2010 respectively. After graduation, he worked in Microsoft China for one year.

Research Interests
======
I am widely interested in computer security and information security areas. Currently, my research topic is applied cryptography (zero-knowledge proofs).

_**Note:** I am **NOT** working in AI-security-related topics. If your previous research area is AI security (or other non-cryptographic areas) and you did not explicitly claim to change your research topic to cryptography, you probably will not get my response._

Teaching
